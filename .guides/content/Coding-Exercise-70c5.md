In this exercise, you will use your skills in image manipulation and GIF creation to generate a visual representation of the four seasons. You will be creating an image of a well in each of the four seasons: `Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring`. Then, with the images generated, you will combine them into a GIF. 

### Objectives
1.Generate the images for each season using the `generate_base_image` function, similar to the example you have already seen. The prompts should be something like `"A well in the summer"`, `"A well in the autumn"`, etc.

2.Download and save the generated images using the `download_image` function. You should save each image with a unique name corresponding to its season.

3.Use the PIL library's image manipulation capabilities to resize the images and create a GIF that loops through each season. Name the gif `well_seasons.gif`.

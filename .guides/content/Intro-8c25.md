We'll explore how to create animations using images generated by the DALL-E 2 API. Animations can be an effective way to showcase the capabilities of the DALL-E 2 API and bring generated images to life. We'll be using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to process and manipulate the generated images and create a GIF animation.

### Creating a Sequence of Images

The first step in creating an animation is to generate a sequence of images with varying properties. We'll use the DALL-E 2 API to generate these images. For this example, let's create an animation of a rotating Earth.

To generate a sequence of images, we can loop through different prompts or modify the prompt with changing properties. In this case, we'll generate images of Earth from different angles. Here's an example code snippet to generate the sequence of images:

```python-hide-clipboard
import main

def generate_earth_image(angle):
    prompt = f"Realistic Earth from space at {angle} degrees angle"
    image_url = main.generate_base_image(prompt)
    image_filename = f"earth_{angle}_degrees"
    image = main.download_image(image_url, image_filename)
    return image


angles = range(0, 360, 10)
earth_images = [generate_earth_image(angle) for angle in angles]
```
In this code, we define a function `generate_earth_image` that takes an `angle` as an argument and generates an image of Earth from that angle using the DALL-E 2 API. We then create a list of angles from 0 to 350 degrees in increments of 10 degrees and generate a corresponding image for each angle.

After generating your images please comment out the code that would generate the images.

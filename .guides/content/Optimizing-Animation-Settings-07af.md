We will explore various options to optimize the GIF animation created using the resized Earth images. We will focus on adjusting the frame duration, loop count, and image optimization settings to make the animation smoother and more visually appealing.

### Adjusting the Duration

You can adjust the duration of each frame in the animation to make the rotation appear faster or slower. The `duration` parameter in the `save` method determines the time each frame is displayed in milliseconds. A lower duration will result in a faster rotation, while a higher duration will make the rotation slower. Experiment with different values to find the optimal speed for your animation. Change the `duration` from 100 to 50 to 200 and compare.
```python
duration = 50  # Adjust the frame duration to your preference
```

{Try it}(python3 main.py 5)

and 
```python
duration = 200  # Adjust the frame duration to your preference
```
{Try it}(python3 main.py 7)

### Adjusting Loop Count
You can control the number of times the animation loops by setting the `loop` parameter in the `save` method. A value of `0`indicates an infinite loop, while a higher value specifies the exact number of loops. For example, if you want the animation to loop only three times, set the loop parameter to `3`
```python
loop_count = 3  # Adjust the loop count to your preference
```
{Try it}(python3 main.py 6)

### Image Optimization
By default, the PIL library doesn't optimize the images in the animation. You can enable image optimization by setting the `optimize` parameter to `True` in the `save` method. This can reduce the file size of the animation while maintaining visual quality.

```python
optimize = True  # Enable image optimization
```
{Try it}(python3 main.py 23)

With these optimizations in place, you should now have a smoother, more visually appealing animation that showcases the Earth rotating using the images generated by the DALL-E 2 API.
